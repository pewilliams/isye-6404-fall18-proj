#Package installation 
install.packages('locpol', dependencies=TRUE, repos='http://cran.rstudio.com/')

#If that doesn't work try 
#https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/locpol/index.html

#In this link, download the package source file (tar.gz)
#Extract the package folder to the folder that holds the library of packages
#and then try doing it. It worked for me, so it may be that there were other packages that needed to be installed as well.
