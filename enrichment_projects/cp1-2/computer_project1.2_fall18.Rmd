## 1. Boostrap Method 

Use the bootstrap method to construct a 90% pointwise confidence interval (CI) of betacoefficient(s)
based on the PH-regression parameter-estimate(s). With the 10000
bootstrap samples you have the entire distribution of beta-estimate(s). Thus, you can use
the methods below to construct CIs.  
i) Calculate standard error (denoted as s.e.(beta-est)) of a beta-estimate from the 1000
bootstrapped beta-estimates. Use [ beta-est. +- 1.645*s.e.(beta-est.) ] as the largesample
CI.  
ii) If the R-program provides 90% confidence interval from either normal or chi-square
approximation based on the large-sample theory, it would be worthwhile to compare
the results against the ones given above to examine what R-program is doing.  
iii) If the distribution of the bootstrap samples of beta-estimate is not symmetric like
normal, use 10000*0.05 = 500th lower and upper percentiles as the second largesample
CI. This is the so-called Percentile-Bootstrap-CI.  
iv) Apply the Bias Correction (BC) Method to obtain BC-Bootstrap-CI. See Section 15.3
textbook for the details of the BC-method.  
v) A better way to construct the large-sample CI for situation in (iii) is to adjust the
percentiles in two tails for having 100 bootstrap samples in total. That is, use a trialand-error
to locate these two tail-percentiles (there are better methods to find them)
for a non-symmetric distribution. For example, one tail might have 700 bootstrap
samples, and the other tail has 300 bootstrap samples. The locations of these two tails
form the CI. Students can look into the so-called Highest-Probability-Density
Confidence Interval (HPD-CI) for a better version of this idea.


## 2. Large-p-Small-n Problems in PH-Regression (30%) 

1) Search the Internet using the key words from the title given in Task #2.  
2) Locate three publications with a section on real-life data analysis/example.  
3) Briefly summarize (in an half-page report for one publication)  
  i) what is the goal of the study,  
  ii) key ideas in solving the problem, and  
  iii) what do you learn from their real-life data study
